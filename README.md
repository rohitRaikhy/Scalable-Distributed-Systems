• Time on Distributed Systems – physical and logical time  
• Consistency  <br>
• Microservices Architecture <br>
• Distributed mutual exclusion and tokens  
• Distributed snapshots and global state  
• Fault tolerance  
• Consensus  

## Projects
1. Built a clone of dropbox.
2. Built a key value store with client, server, coordinator achitecture.
