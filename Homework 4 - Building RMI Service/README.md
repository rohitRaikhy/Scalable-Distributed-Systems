# Building RMI Service ordered list of integers

This implementation of Remote Procedural Call utilizes java RMI interface to solve a rudimentary resource extensive task of ordering a set of numbers. The set of number is small in this case as used as a simple example. RPC allows for distrubted system architecure to access a remote machine and implement methods on that machine which tends to have much greater resources to complete the task at hand. 

## To compile and run the code

In terminal run: rmiregistry
<br>
In another terminal run: java SorterServer
<br>
In another terminal run: java SorterClient
